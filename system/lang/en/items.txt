Horde of orcs poured out of the mountains like a wave.\n\nOrcs live mainly underground in caves, or outside in the woods. Rarely break temporary camps under the open sky, they fear that the sky will collapse on their heads. They use a primitive language which, once written, looks like a scribble. Rarely happens that the orc is not a half-wit, then he becomes a shaman. Some shamans know the language of people.\n\nThe strongest orc becomes the warlord or leader. The only thing holding up his army of orcs is fear of its leader. Often, there is a fierce battle between them to find out who are stronger."

In particular, potions to alchemist, food from the seller of the food and alcohol from the inn. What you do not need, sell.\n2. Do not travel alone, the more characters in the team, the easier it will be to fight. Try to have at least 3-4 people in your team. At first you will find some hero who will join you for free.\n3. Get as many items as you can and then sell them in the city. Your allies can also come in handy and carry items for you.\n4. Outside the fight, you should use food to heal. Drinking a mixture of natural healing increases the amount of healing for food / rest. It is worth leaving healing potions for fight.\n5. Find unique allies who will help you. You can recruit them early, have unique abilities and do not require share of gold.\n6. If you can afford to buy better armor, do it right now. At the beginning every point of defense counts.\n7. If you want to clean a location ask the locals for nearby places. For starters, you should visit places where enemies are very weak or weak.\n8. Do not attack the city residents! Unless you want to never buy or train anymore.\n9. Do not be afraid to run away when chances for victory are tiny.\n10. Save game often and don't die."

Summoning\nTo summon a creature from another plane, you need to know it name and have piece of the element from which it originated. For example, for a fire elemental something related to fire, lit piece of coal. Summoning standard elementals does not pose a problem because they all have the same names:\nfire - agni\nwater - pos\nair - mir\nearth - ar\nSummoning beings from other planes is not described in this volume. Prior to summoning you should also prepare a protective circle - otherwise the elemental will not have friendly intentions. After summoning use one of binding spells.\n\n2. Opening portals\nTo open the portal you need a specially prepared gate. For this purpose you can use, for example, an adamentium that is resistant to sorcery. Using too weak gate can cause damage and collapse of the portal, which is extremely dangerous. You need to cast gate spell on portal. The portal remains open for an unlimited amount of time."
