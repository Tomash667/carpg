	text "*** Orc horde ***\n\nOrcs were first encountered in the year 713 of the first era. Not much was known about them, they were perceived as mere humanoid beasts murdering villagers and burning villages. They came from the northern mountains when winter arrived. Hordes of orcs poured out of the mountains like a wave.\n\nOrcs live mainly underground in caves, or outside, in the woods. They rarely break temporary camps under the open sky, since they fear that the sky will collapse on their heads. They use a primitive language which, once written, looks like scribbles. It rarely happens that an orc is not a half-wit. When this is the case and he's neither a dimwit, he becomes a shaman. Some shamans know the language of our people.\n\nThe strongest orc becomes the warlord or leader. The only thing holding up his army of orcs is fear of its leader. Often, there is a fierce battle between them to find out who is the strongest."

Alone, it does not pose a greater threat, but they usually come in groups and are armed with weapons, shields or bow. Skeletons are resistant to pierce damage, but susceptible to blunt weapons. It is good to carry a morningstar, for example.\n\nSkeleton mage - bones undead, thanks to the vile power can cast spells. It has the same features as a regular skeleton. It should be eliminated in the first place, which is not always easy to do when he is surrounded by allies. Stronger skeletons can rise other skeletons up and throw exploding skulls.\n\nZombie - a corpse animated with corrupted magic. Extremely durable and resistant to piercing and blunt weaponry. It's best to use their slowness to one's advantage - shoot from the distance with the bow and when it is damaged enough, finish it off with a sword.\n\nUndead guard - an animated man who has not yet become a zombie. Strong as a man but more durable, resistant to bruises and poisons.\n\nNecromancer - He is not undead, but he must be described here. It is he who performs wicked witchcraft and animates skeletons and zombies. He should be killed in the first place!"

In particular potions of an alchemist, food from the grocer and alcohol from the inn. What you do not need, sell.\n2. Do not travel alone, the more characters in the team, the easier it will be to fight. Try to have at least 3-4 people in your team. At first you will find some heroes who will join you for free.\n3. Get as many items as you can and sell them in the city. Your allies can also come in handy and carry items for you.\n4. Outside the fight, you should use food to heal. Drinking a mixture of natural healing increases the amount of healing from food / rest. It is worth leaving healing potions for fights.\n5. Find unique allies who will help you. You can recruit them early on, they have unique abilities and do not require share of gold.\n6. If you can afford to buy better armor, do it right now. At the beginning every point of defense counts.\n7. If you want to clean a location, ask the locals for nearby places. For starters, you should visit places where enemies are very weak or weak.\n8. Do not attack the city residents! Unless you want to never buy or train anymore.\n9. Do not be afraid to run away when chances for victory are tiny.\n10. Save the game often and don't die."

The dreamer has control over himself and what happens in a dream. As far as this is his dream...\n\nOne of the methods is to test the reality and to save daily dream experiences.

Summoning\nTo summon a creature from another plane, you need to know its name and have piece of the element from which it originated. For example, for a fire elemental something related to fire, like a lit piece of coal. Summoning standard elementals does not pose a problem because they all have the same names:\nfire - agni\nwater - pos\nair - mir\nearth - ar\nSummoning beings from other planes is not described in this volume. Prior to summoning you should also prepare a protective circle - otherwise the elemental will not have friendly intentions. After summoning, use one of the binding spells.\n\n2. Opening portals\nTo open the portal you need a specially prepared gate. For this purpose you can use, for example, an adamentium that is resistant to sorcery. Using a gate that isn't sufficiently strong can cause damage and collapse of the portal, which is extremely dangerous. You need to cast the gate spell on the portal. The portal remains open for an unlimited amount of time."
