## How to build

Copy game content from latest release and put it inside bin/data folder.

CaRpg uses git submodule to link to [carpglib](https://github.com/Tomash667/carpglib) engine. To download everything use git command:
```
git submodule update --init
```

Open solution carpg.sln with Visual Studio 2017 (15.9.X) and use build. All dependencies and game should compile (client_dbg/client_dbg2 are for debugging multiplayer and can be unloaded).

Important branches:
- **dev** - development branch where all new features are added
- **master** - stable and tested branch where only fixes *should* be added
