paker [switches] version

7zip must be installed to create zip, and added to PATH variable.

Switches:
-help - display help
-nozip - don't create zip or pak
-normal - create full pak (default)
-patch - create patch pak
-both - create full & patch pak
-blob - for patch don't create zip but pak file that is uploaded to azure blob

Examples:
paker 0.17 -- create full version zip
paker -patch 0.17.1 -- create patch version zip (only files that changed before previous version)
paker -both -blob 0.18 -- create full version zip and pak for upgrade from 0.17 -> 0.18 [recommended workflow for version > 0.17 to allow auto-updates]
