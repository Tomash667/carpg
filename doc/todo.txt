- don't focus chest when there is user
	+ looted is not set/sent
===============================================================================================================
NEW:
- green screen, cannot reproduce
? using cheats to exit from arena/tournament
- travel on worldmap is a bit out of sync, clicking instantly after travel will error on server, thinking that team not yet entered location, forward prediction should be easy here
- changing vsync reset failed, cannot reproduce

+ move chest to usables
+ particles in objects, not hardcoded water_effect, blood_effect
+ remove hardcoded bench variants in base usable
+ remove hardcoded ai to use read papers animation on chair, eat food on stool
+ remove obj_alpha
+ validate objects metadata (required objects, units)
? why version/stats thread start at menu, not while loading
- grass under moon well
+ exporter: when file has no ext or ends with .qmsh save as .qmsh.tmp

- arena picks random units and try spawn them at specified levels but it is still limited to max level (for example orc 4)
	it should pirst units at that level, if not possible lower/higher

+ modify units stats, perks -> will make unit unique
+ poison resistance from stamina
+ wisdom: skill/perk/bonus
