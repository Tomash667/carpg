===============================================================================================================
NEXT:
+ shortcuts bar
+ eating lots of food before combat can grant very fast regeneration for up to 60 sec (honeycomb with healthy diet)..., on the other hand 100 end perk gives only 5 regen/sec, maybe it should be %/sec, limit max active healing from food to 5/10 ?
===============================================================================================================
CURRENT:

- NetChange::ADD_LOCATION memory leak for client (T between 2 cities with warp to inn?)
- quitting with sounds attached to player = crash
- arena picks random units and try spawn them at specified levels but it is still limited to max level (for example orc 4)
	it should pirst units at that level, if not possible lower/higher
- archers stupidly come closer to target when out of stamina
- removing player in mp game, update effect will show assert on GetPlayerInfo
- clear remove console history
===============================================================================================================
NEW:
