1. Building group
Building groups are used because now unit can't simply go to inn, there are more
	inns with different ids, so game search by group. Currently anything here is
	required (check required.txt) because some things are hardcoded (like filling
	items in front of alchemist shop or food seller)
	
2. Building
building ID {
	mesh MESH_FILE - building mesh
	inside_mesh MESH_FILE - inside building mesh
	schema { 
		# - building, spawn square physics, shows on minimap
		| - building, no physics - used with new buildings that have custom physics, shows on minimap
		@ - unit spawn point, sand
		+ - road (sand or stone)
		  - grass
	} - building terrain schema (what tiles put where, grass, dirt, road), physics
	shift {bottom right up lef} - shift in tiles when spawning rotated building
	flags
		favor_center - favor center of map when spawning
		favor_road - favor near road when spawning
		have_name - load name from file and draws it on map
		list - shows text on world map
	group group_name - building group
	unit id - spawn unit on @
}

3. Building script
Script for spawning buildings in city/village
Keywords:
	X (building) - add building (X can be also group "group inn")
	random {X Y Z} - add one of random buildings
	variant { } - settlement variant
	shuffle start/end - start shuffle, end shuffle elements
	required off - buildings aren't required to spawn, used for houses
	var NAME - declare new variable
	set VAR [op]= X [op Y [op Z...]] - set variable to value
		(X can be variable or number or function, op is + - / *)
	inc/dec VAR - increase/decrease VAR by 1
	if X - checks if it's valid, X can be:
		rand X - random chance (rand()%X == 0), for 0 it return false
		X op Y (op > >= < <= == !=)
	endif - end of if block
	else - if else block

Build in variables:
	count - number of buildings to spawn (default 1)
	counter - generic counter (default 0)
	citizens - number of citizens in city (units)
	citizens_world - number displayed on world map
	
Functions:
	random(x,y) - returns random number [x, y]

Building generation takes two steps:
 1. On world generation - generate required buildings
 2. On enter location - generate not required buildings, variables except 
 	citizens and citizens_world don't keep their value 
Buildings that aren't required but are marked as LIST won't show on worldmap
	until visited.
