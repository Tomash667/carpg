Preamble
========

This is a quick summary/guide provided to help with complying to the license
terms, if you are using solely the core functionality of SLikeNet (i.e. no
samples, no dependent extensions, and no optional core features) without
distributing the source code.
This is also the case, if you are building your application with the prebuilt
SLikeNet library files marked with "_core" in the library file name. If you are
building your application with the prebuilt libraries marked with "_ext",
please refer to the file _quick_licensing_slikenet_extended.txt instead.

Further understand that these instructions are solely provided as a guideline
to comply with licensing requirements. Legally bound instructions are solely
covered by the actual license terms of the SLikeNet license and the
dependencies it utilizes. Please refer to chapter 7 in the readme.txt file for
detailed information!
