Preamble
========

This is a quick summary/guide provided to help with complying to the license
terms, if you are using solely the SLikeNet core with the libcatid and OpenSSL
3rd-party libraries (i.e. no samples, no dependent extensions, and no optional
core features except for ipv6 and LIBCAT_SECURITY) without distributing the
source code.
This is also the case, if you are building your application with the prebuilt
SLikeNet library files marked with "_ext" in the library file name. If you are
building your application with the prebuilt libraries marked with "_core",
please refer to the file _quick_licensing_slikenet_core.txt instead.

Further understand that these instructions are solely provided as a guideline
to comply with licensing requirements. Legally bound instructions are solely
covered by the actual license terms of the SLikeNet license and the
dependencies it utilizes. Please refer to chapter 7 in the readme.txt file for
detailed information!
